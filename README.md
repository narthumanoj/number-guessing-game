# 🎯 Number Guessing Game

This is a simple command-line Python project where the computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the player tries to guess it.

---

## 🧠 How It Works

- A random number is generated using Python's `random` module.
- You keep entering guesses until you find the right number.
- The program tells you if your guess is **too high** or **too low**.
- Finally, it tells you how many tries you took.
